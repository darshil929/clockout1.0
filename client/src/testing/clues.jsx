        In the 1700s, nestled in a remote village in Italy, lived a reclusive scientist named Dante. Driven by a relentless curiosity, he toiled endlessly in his makeshift laboratory, experimenting with the arcane secrets of mathematics and sciences. One fateful night, amidst a wild storm, Dante found himself only one tricky step away from a mysteriously intriguing creation. He found a puzzle that could help him birth the world’s first artificial intelligence.

    alertMessage: "The puzzle oozed out a chilling aura of a sinister demonic presence. Driven by superstition and paranoia, Dante believed that the devil himself had invaded his creation as punishment for his audacious experiments Terrified and overwhelmed by guilt, Dante decided to bury his algorithms deep beneath the foundation of the village's old church. He believed that by doing so, he could exorcize the malevolent spirit that had plagued his invention."

        PAST 2:
      </li> <br />
      <li>
        The world descended into chaos with the outbreak of World War II. A church in Italy, like many other buildings, suffered damage from artillery shelling, and its foundations were uprooted. While clearing up the ruins of the church, some Nazis discovered bits and pieces of paper that seemed to be some mathematical algorithm. They sent them to their headquarters for further analysis and found out that it was an algorithm to create an A.I. entity so powerful it could control the entire world! The Nazis were determined to take full advantage of this new-found discovery to tip the scales of the war in their favor.
      </li> <br />
      <li>
        They wanted to keep their discovery hidden from the Allies at all costs. So, they put Dante's book in an extremely secure safe that no one could break into.
      </li> <br />
      <li>
        They had interpreted Dante's algorithm and wanted to use it to make a competitor to Alan Turing’s new invention. In order to do so they needed to send it to their Germany HQ safely. To find a safe channel to communicate on, they must decrypt a secret message sent through a Secret code from their HQ.
